# test_ECG-Signal-Viewer
Development repository. 

Experiment language, libraries; development & test on new features for release on `Ecg-Signal-Viewer`. 



## Guideline
Files at root prefixed with `ecg_` are for release. 

Files of the form `ecg_dev_run-(.*).py` are time sensitive, iterative scripts for Dash web app integration. 
Only the most recent versions are meaningful and relevant.
See [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LoDe0fVXWghLS3dO6EcsUCoV639Plo7I) `~/Dev Progress` folder 
for a more detailed development record.  
 
`dev` folder contains unit tests at various scale on language and python package functionality. 
 
`assets` folder contains `CSS` files per [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com). 
 
`Design` folder contains design, in particular color choices.
